(* The pretty rendering algorithm: preliminary declarations. *)

(* The renderer is supposed to behave exactly like Daan Leijen's, although its
   implementation is quite radically different. Instead of relying on
   Haskell's lazy evaluation mechanism, we implement an abstract machine with
   mutable current state, forking, backtracking (via an explicit stack of
   choice points), and cut (disposal of earlier choice points). *)

(* The renderer's input consists of an ordered sequence of documents. Each
   document carries an extra indentation level, akin to an implicit [Nest]
   constructor, and a ``flattening'' flag, which, if set, means that this
   document should be printed in flattening mode. *)

(* An alternative coding style would be to avoid decorating each input
   document with an indentation level and a flattening mode, and allow
   the input sequence to contain instructions that set the current
   nesting level or reset the flattening mode. That would perhaps be
   slightly more readable, and slightly less efficient. *)

(* When possible (that is, when the stack is empty), the renderer writes

   a failure point is reached (then, the buffered output is discarded) or a
   cut is reached (then, all buffered output is committed to the output
   channel). At all times, the length of the buffered output is at most one
   line. *)

     empty, and the leading [ICons] constructor is inlined within the state
     record. In other words, the fields [nest1], [flatten1], and [input1]
     concern the first input document, and the field [input] contains the
     rest of the input sequence. *)

   flattening mode is off. Furthermore, when flattening mode is on,
   all groups are ignored, so no new choice points are pushed onto the

   so that the stack height is zero when flattening mode is off and
   one when flattening mode is on. *)
